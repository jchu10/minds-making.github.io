          Minds in the Making is a new workshop at the interface between
          cognitive science ðŸ§  and design thinking ðŸ«–. The human capacity to
          shape our environments and experiences has long inspired research
          across many disciplines, from psychology and neuroscience to
          human-computer interaction and education. However, these communities
          have not generally had the opportunity to exchange insights. Our
          workshop aims to bridge this gap, fostering interdisciplinary
          knowledge sharing to deepen our understanding of human creativity and
          design cognition.
          <div className="my-4">
            We focus on two central questions about design cognition: <br />
            <span className="ml-12">
              1. How do people reason about design decisions?
            </span>
            <br />
            <span className="ml-12">
              2. How does design impact human behavior and learning?
            </span>
          </div>
          For more information, read our workshop proposal <a href="https://google.com" className="underline text-red-700">here</a>. <br /> Format In
          2025, Minds in the Making will take place as a series of four virtual
          online seminars â€” free & open to the public â€” featuring interactive
          conversations with experts from cognitive science, education, design,
          human-computer interaction. Weâ€™re also planning for in-person
          activities (details tbd).
